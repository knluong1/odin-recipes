    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I like it Piccata</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 stick butter</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white wine</li>
        <li>3 medium lemons, juiced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dranied capers</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice chicken breasts horizontally to yield 4 pieces. 
            Place breasts between 2 sheets of plastic wrap and pound 
            to 1/4-inch thin. Place flour on a plate and dredge 
            each breasts on both sides in flour.
        </li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Put chicken into the skillet and season 
            tops with salt and pepper. Turn when nicely browned, about 4 minutes 
            , and season again. Cook second side until browned, about 4 
            minutes. Transfer breasts to a plate, reserving skillet drippings.
        </li>
        <li>Add wine and lemon juice to the skillet, stirring to scrape up any browned bits. Simmer to reduce and thicken sauce, 
            about 5 minutes more. Add capers and pour sauce over chicken 
            breasts on the plate. Sprinkle with parsley.
        </li>
    </ol>
